## A package for people who don't want to learn or read regexes

ReadableRegex.jl gives you a syntax that is much easier to write and understand
than the rather cryptic standard Regex. The syntax is as close as possible to
a natural language description of the Regex. Here's an example:

Quickly, what does this regex do?

```julia
regex = r"[\+-]?(?:\d*\.)?\d+"
```

Compare with this:

```julia
regex = maybe(["-", "+"]) *
            maybe(any_of(DIGIT) * ".") *
            at_least_one(DIGIT)
```

Both of these match all kinds of floating point numbers like these:

`"1 2.0 .3 -.4 -5 60 700 800.9 +9000"`

But to understand the Regex you have to mentally parse it into the second version.
Why not avoid that effort?

ReadableRegex also escapes reserved regex characters like "." by default, saving you a lot of backslashes.


## Constants

These constants hold commonly used abbreviations:

| Constant | Regex |
| -- | -- |
| `WORD` | `\w` |
| `NON_WORD` | `\W` |
| `DIGIT` | `\d` |
| `NON_DIGIT` | `\D` |
| `WHITESPACE` | `\s` |
| `NON_LINEBREAK` | `.` |
| `ANY` | `[\s\S]` |
| `BEGIN` | `^` |
| `END` | `$` |
| `WORDBOUND` | `\b` |
| `NON_WORDBOUND` | `\B` |

## These functions access the typical regex building blocks

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `at_least_one(target)` | Match one or more repetitions of `target`|
| `at_least(n, target)` | Match at least `n` repetitions of `target`|
| `between(low, high, target)` | Match between `low` and `high` repetitions of `target` |
| `maybe(target)` | Match zero or one repetitions of `target` |
| `exactly(n, target)` | Match exactly `n` repetitions of `target` |
| `any_of(target)` | Match zero to infinity repetitions of `target` |
| `matchonly(target; [after, before, not_after, not_before])` | Match `target` only if it is either `before`, `after`, `not_after`, or `not_before` other matches. Only one keyword can be set at a time. |
| `one_out_of(targets...)` | Match one target out of all given `targets` (the first in order if multiple could match)|

## Conversions

Some constructs from Base Julia are useful to express building blocks of regular expression.
You can define `Base.convert(::Type{RegexString}, obj)` to use these directly in ReadableRegex expressions.
All building block functions call `convert` on their inputs.

Some predefined examples:

### `String` and `Char`

Strings and Chars are escaped when converted, so you can use `.+[]` etc. without escaping them manually.

```julia
at_least_one("+")
maybe("[text in brackets]")
```

### `StepRange{Char, Int}`

Char ranges can be used directly and match any char within the range.

```julia
at_least_one('a':'z')
between(1, 4, 'ðŸŒ‘':'ðŸŒ˜')
```

### `AbstractVector` and `Tuple`

Using an AbstractVector or a Tuple is the same as calling `one_out_of(vec_or_tup...)`.

```julia
exactly(3, ['a':'z', "ha"])
maybe(('x', 'Y'))
```
